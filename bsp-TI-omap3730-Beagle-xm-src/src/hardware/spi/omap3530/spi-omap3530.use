%C Driver for OMAP3530 SPI controllers

Syntax:
    spi-master -d omap3530 [option[,option ...]] ... &

Options (to override autodetected defaults):

    "base",         /* Base address for this CSPI controller */
    "bitrate",      /* defines teh bitrate to to assigned to the spi */
    "clock",        /* defined the value of the clock source of the SPI */
    "channel",      /* defines the connected channel number (1,2,3, or 4) */
    "irq",          /* IRQ for this CSPI intereface */
    "force",        /* Force the default CSx level */
    "num_cs"        /* number of support devices on this channel (default=1)*/
    "sdma",         /* Disable/enable SDMA for SPI, 1:enable SDMA, 0:disable SDMA (default)*/ 
    "cs_delay"     /* Disable/enable 1 1/2 clock CS to data delay, 1:delay, 0:no delay (default) */  
Examples:
    # Start McSPI driver with base address, IRQ and waitstates....
    spi-master -u0 -d omap3530 base=0x4809A000,bitrate=125000,clock=48000000,irq=66,force=1,channel=2,sdma=1
